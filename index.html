            Great leaders do not desire to lead but to serve, 
            there is leadership potential
            in every person. Despite this universal latent ability,
            very few individual realize the power,
            and fwer still have responded effectively to the call.
             As a result ,our nations
            , societies, and communities are suffering from an 
            astounding leadership void.
             Where are the genuine leader? where are the individuals
              who are willing to take 
             responsibility for the present situation and conditions in the world?
              who is 
             is willing to accept the challenge, to face it head-on with integrity,
              character,
             and a commitment to execte righteous judgement for a better world?

            here are two important concept to note  about leaders which are; leaders are either
            made or born but majority of the leaders in our world today walk their 
            ways to the top. They work assiduosly on themselves. It is important to know that
            some people might fall into the category of born leaders 
            but they may eventually die as a slave because leadersship requires hard work. One don't become leader 
            leader by doing nothing.

            “You can do as much as you think you can,
            But you’ll never accomplish more;
            If you’re afraid of yourself, young man,
            There’s little for you in store.
            For failure comes from the inside first,
            It’s there if we only knew it,
            And you can win, though you face the worst,
            If you feel that you’re going to do it.”

            For most men and women do not need “charity” — or even sympathy. What they do
                need is inspiration—and opportunity—the kind of inspiration that makes a man go out and
                create his own opportunity. And that, after all, is the greatest good one can do to anyone. Few
                people appreciate free gifts. They are like the man whom admiring townsfolk presented with
                a watch. He looked it over critically for a minute. Then—”Where’s the chain?” he asked.
                But a way to win for themselves the full measure of success they’ve dreamed of but almost
                    stopped hoping for—that is something every young couple would welcome with open arms.
                    And it is something that, if I can do it justice, will make the “Eternal Triangle” as rare as it is
                    today common, for it will enable husband and wife to work together—not merely for
                        domestic happiness, but for business success as well
